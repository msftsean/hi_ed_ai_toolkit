## 🎯 Key Takeaways from the Event

### Main Themes

1. **Ethics is the Edge**
   - Technology is democratized (everyone has GPT-4o, Azure)
   - Competitive advantage = responsible deployment
   - Governance must move at the speed of innovation

2. **Boundaries as Design**
   - Encode values from day one, don't bolt them on
   - Define what agents CAN and CANNOT do
   - Example: Crisis escalation always requires human intervention

3. **Community Learning**
   - Moltbook showed real-time security response
   - Open-source collaboration accelerates hardening
   - Learn in public, fail fast, adapt quickly
