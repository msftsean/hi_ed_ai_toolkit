## 🎯 Core Principles

This toolkit embodies the following principles from our "Ethics is the Edge" framework:

2. **⚡ Speed with Guardrails** - Move fast, but responsibly
3. **🔍 Transparency by Design** - Build trust through openness
4. **🤝 Human-Centered** - Technology serves people, not replaces them
5. **📚 Learn in Public** - Share successes and failures
6. **🔄 Adaptive Governance** - Principles over rigid policies
7. **💡 Boundaries as Design** - Encode values, don't bolt them on
